# Review-Analysis
Faculty review analysis is a crucial part in an organisation. Proper communication between students and faculties must be ensured for
better quality of education.
This project is developed to automate the analysis part of the feedback review process. The system converts qualitative measure 
i.e. feedback given by students into a class based category (Positive or Negative) which makes it easier to deduce a potential improvement
opportunity in the organisation.
